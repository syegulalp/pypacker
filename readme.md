# PyPacker: a dumb little script for turning Python apps into standalone executable packages on Windows

PyPacker is my attempt at creating a way to make Python apps fully portable on Windows. It does this by performing *live program analysis* to determine what to pack up.

## Rationale

Most systems for turning Python apps into standalone programs analyze the program to determine what and how to pack things up, but don't actually run the program in question, and so have no information about the program's runtime behavior.

PyPacker runs the program and makes a record of all the imports actually used during the program's lifetime. It then uses this information to create a standalone redistributable of the application.

The downside of this approach is that you have to perform at least one run with the program that provides the broadest possible program coverage -- e.g., all imports are fully executed, etc.

The upside is that PyPacker knows exactly what to copy. Also, your trace files can be reused as long as no new program components have been added in the meantime. And because the unmodified Python runtime is included, this minimizes the chances your package will be flagged as malware.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment for your project. (Optional, but let's face it, you should do this anyway.)

`pip install` the contents of the repository.

You can also install directly from Github:

`pip install -U https://github.com/syegulalp/pypacker/zipball/main`

If you have Git installed:

`pip install -U git+https://github.com/syegulalp/pypacker`

## Usage

### 1. Run application

Run PyPacker like so:

`py -m pypacker -a entry_point.py`

where `entry_point.py` is the entry point to your application.

* If just importing `entry_point.py` starts your application, PyPacker will detect that.
* However, if `entry_point.py` has an `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` guard, or something similar, use the `-f` switch to indicate what function to use as the entry point. E.g., for `main()`, use `-f main`.

### 2. Generate coverage analysis

When your application launches, make sure you use as much of its functionality as possible, to generate the maximum possible analysis coverage.

When your application exits, PyPacker it will generate a `tracefile.json` file that can be re-used for future runs (by just typing `py -m pypacker` in that directory).

### 3. Pack app for redistribution

After either running a new analysis or reading in an existing one, PyPacker will package your application for redistribution.

The resulting redistributable will be placed in the `dist` subdirectory. A zipped version of the redistributable directory is also provided.

### 4. Repack application on future runs

If you want to make changes to the app that don't impact its analysis (e.g., no new imports), you can just run `py -m pypacker` (along with any needed command-line switches described below) on the directory with the `tracefile.json` file to repack the app.

## What PyPacker tries to do

* The main program tree is turned into a `.zip` file (of `.pyc` files).
* Any non-Python files in the main program tree are copied into a parallel directory off the root of the `dist` directory.
* Usage of `.pyd` files and (some) `.dll`s are automatically detected as well and copied.
* Third-party packages are also included.
* Both console and windowed executables are provided.
* Using TKinter and SQLite3 should be automatically detected, and the appropriate files should be copied into your redistributable.
* Numpy can now also be included, although you cannot use treeshaking with it (use the option `-tlx numpy`).

## Recommendations

PyPacker works best with a program structure like this:

```
entrypoint.py
    \ appdir
```

where `entrypoint.py` is what's executed to start your app, and your actual app and all its files live in `appdir` and below. This makes it easier for PyPacker to detect data files that are adjacent to your application.

Start by using only `-a` to specify which file to analyze (along with `-f` if needed), and no other options. If your program seems stable, rerun without `-a` (unless you've made changes) and try applying optimizations and then treeshaking.

## Options

The following command line options are supported:

* `-a` -- Specify an entry point for analysis. Not needed if you're re-using a previously generated analysis.
* `-v` -- Verbose output.
* `-ax` -- Retain temporary files after completion of analysis. These are typically deleted automatically, but they can be saved for troubleshooting.
* `-f` -- Specify an entry point function for the script, e.g., `-f main`.

### Advanced options

These options provide more compact output, but at the risk of the program not working correctly.

* `-ta` -- Treeshaking analysis on the application. Attempts to copy *only* the application modules that ran during the analysis phase.
* `-tl` -- Treeshaking analysis on the libraries. Attempts to copy *only* the library modules that ran during the analysis phase.
* `-t` -- Shortcut for `-ta` and `-tl`.
* `-tli <libname>` -- Treeshake library `<libname>` only.
* `-tlx <libname>` -- Exclude library `<libname>` from treeshaking (implies `-tl`).
* `-o [1/2]` -- Specify optimization level for .pyc files, default is 0. (Some modules, such as NumPy, will object if you remove docstrings by way of optimization level 2.)
## Caveats

Very buggy. Drastically incomplete.

Treeshaking is highly experimental.

If you are packing up a single file that requires the presence of other non-Python files, they will not be detected. I'm working on a mechanism to allow arbitrary files to be added to the package.
